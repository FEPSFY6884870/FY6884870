            Lift is one of the fundamental forces in which enables aircraft to overcome gravity, maintaining flight. Within this article the science behind lift is explored, focusing upon the 
            aerodynamic principles which allow aircraft (mainly airplanes) to stay in the sky. It introduces the four fundamental forces in flight with the emphasis being on lift and its vital
            role in opposing the aircrafts weight. Thereafter magnifying onto key concepts of what contributes to lift which consist of Bernoulli’s principle, airfoil design, and the angle of 
            attack. Also talking about the relationship between airflow, pressure differences, and the actual shape of the wing. By unravelling the science behind lift, this article aims to provide
            a clear explanation of how airplanes harness aerodynamic forces to fly in the air.

            Aerodynamics is the study of how air interacts with objects, in this case particularly airplanes. It is essential in aviation being utilised for design of efficient and safe
            airplanes that can travel efficiently around the world. 
            Lift is a core force within aerodynamics and possibly the most significant during flight. It is the force which enables planes and aircraft of the like to overcome the force 
            of its weight. Lift is generated primarily by the wings of an aircraft, where differences in air pressure above and below the wings create an upward force. Lift is crucial not 
            only for take-off but also for sustained flight. Understanding how lift works is essential for pilots, engineers, and anyone involved in aviation, as it directly influences the 
            design of aircraft and the efficiency of flight. (van Dam, 2002)
